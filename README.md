# DataSci112Final
This is the repo for my final project for Stanford's DataSci 112 class. I worked with Susie Guo and together, we webscraped Tabelog restaurant reviews in Kyoto. Then, we plotted this information, trying to investigate the impacts of gentrification on the city. The poster can be found [here](https://github.com/maxnlee/DataSci112Final/blob/main/Final%20Datasci112%20Project.pdf).
